## About the Project

This repository contains a series of web pages dedicated to presenting my projects and experiments in the fields of:
- Mathematics
- Cryptography
- Computer Science

The repository also hosts various **interactive tools** designed to help users explore and understand these topics more effectively.

## Features

- Showcase of educational projects and tools.
- Focus on mathematics and computer science concepts.
- Interactive tools that provide hands-on experience with cryptographic and mathematical operations.

## Getting Started

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fer-osorio/mathematical-foundations.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd mathematical-foundations
   ```

3. **Open the HTML files in your browser**
   Most of the functionality runs directly on the browser as the project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
